<h1>&sect;3.2: Properties of determinants</h1>

<p>
<b>TL;DR</b>
We will learn how to calculate determinants by row reduction,
and some properties, including:
a matrix is invertible if and only if it has non-zero determinant;
and det(AB)=det(A)det(B).
</p>

<h2>Announcements</h2>

<p>
Exams are graded.
I hope the TAs will finish entering the data soon.
I do not have any statistics yet,
but the graders seem happy.
The scale is the one
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States">
Wikipedia says</a>
is "used by four different colleges in the United States".
</p>

<p>
Some people want to take the next exam or the final exam early.
Send me an email if you would be interested and have not already told me.
</p>

<p>
Official policy on clickers is:
if you forget to bring it,
or it inexplicably does not record your attendance,
then that's too bad.
However I still get daily emails and requests about this.
Therefore I put up a "forum" on Gauchospace to discuss this
and other good or bad feelings you have about clickers.
</p>

<h2>Theorems in &sect;3.1&ndash;2</h2>

<ol>
<li> You can calculate determinants by
     cofactor expansion along any row or column. </li>
<li> You can easily calculate the determinant of a triangular matrix. </li>
<li> You can calculate a determinant using row operations. </li>
<li> A matrix is invertible &hArr; it has non-zero determinant. </li>
<li> $\operatorname{det}A^T = \operatorname{det} A$. </li>
<li> $\operatorname{det}(AB)=(\operatorname{det}A)(\operatorname{det}B)$. </li>
</ol>

<p>
You do not need to know how to prove them,
but I will say something about why they are true.
</p>

<h2>Theorem 1</h2>

<p>
Use this to compute the determinant
by "strategic" cofactor expansion.
If possible, choose a row or column with a lot of zeros.
</p>

<p>
The textbook omits the proof of Theorem 1
"to avoid a lengthy digression",
so I will too.
</p>

<h2>Theorem 2</h2>

<p>
The determinant of a triangular matrix
is the product of the diagonal entries.
</p>

<p>
This is because of
repeated
"strategic" cofactor expansions.
</p>

<h2>Theorem 3</h2>

<p>
Recall the three kinds of row operations: swap, scale, replace.
Here is how they affect the determinant.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <span class=red>Swap</span>: multiply det by -1. </li>
<li> <span class=red>Scale</span>: multiply det by the scalar. </li>
<li> <span class=red>Replace</span>: det does not change! </li>
</ul>

<p>
I will just show you for $2 \times 2$ matrices.
(The book then uses the cofactor expansion and mathematical induction
to prove it for larger matrices.)
</p>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
\left| \begin{array}{cc} c & d \\ a & b \end{array} \right| &= cb - da = -(ad-bc) \\
\left| \begin{array}{cc} ka & kb \\ c & d \end{array} \right| &= (ka)d - (kb)c = k(ad-bc) \\
\left| \begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ c+ka & d+kb \end{array} \right| &= a(d+kb) - b(c+ka) = ad-bc
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<p>
You can use this to compute the determinant.
Echelon form is upper triangular,
so its determinant is the product of the entries on the main diagonal.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

Let's calculate the determinant of
$\left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
2 & 4 & 6 \\ 3 & 6 & 10 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{array} \right]$
by different methods.

<h3>Cofactor expansion</h3>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
\left| \begin{array}{ccc} 2 & 4 & 6 \\ 3 & 6 & 10 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{array} \right|
&=
2 \left| \begin{array}{cc} 6 & 10 \\ 1 & 1 \end{array} \right|
- 4 \left| \begin{array}{cc} 3 & 10 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right|
+ 6 \left| \begin{array}{cc} 3 & 6 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right|
\\ &= 2(-4) - 4(3) + 6(3)
\\ &= -2
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<h3>Strategic cofactor expansion</h3>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
\left| \begin{array}{ccc} 2 & 4 & 6 \\ 3 & 6 & 10 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{array} \right|
&=
0 \left| \begin{array}{cc} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 10 \end{array} \right|
- 1 \left| \begin{array}{cc} 2 & 6 \\ 3 & 10 \end{array} \right|
+ 1 \left| \begin{array}{cc} 2 & 4 \\ 3 & 6 \end{array} \right|
\\ &= 0(4) - 1(2) + 1(0)
\\ &= -2
\end{align}
$$
</p>

<h3>Row operations</h3>

<p>
$$
\begin{align}
\left| \begin{array}{ccc} 2 & 4 & 6 \\ 3 & 6 & 10 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{array} \right|
&= 2 \left| \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 3 & 6 & 10 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{array} \right|
\\ &= 2 \left| \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \end{array} \right|
\\ &= -2 \left| \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right|
\\ &= -2
\end{align}
$$

<h3>Dodgson condensation</h3>

<p>
You do not need to know this method,
and it does not always work,
but I will show it to you anyway.

<h2>Theorem 4</h2>

<p class=boxed>
A is invertible &hArr; det A &ne; 0
</p>

<p>
Use row reduction to calculate the determinant of $A$.
You get plus-or-minus a product of scalars times
the determinant of its echelon form.
None of the scalars are zero
because you are not allowed to scale a row by zero.
</p>

<p>
If $A$ is invertible then its echelon form
has pivots all down the main diagonal,
so its determinant is non-zero.
Or you could go all the way to reduced echelon form $I$,
which has determinant one.
</p>

<p>
If $A$ is not invertible then its reduced echelon form has a row of zeros,
so its determinant is $0$.
</p>

<h2>Theorem 5</h2>

<p class=boxed>
$\operatorname{det} A^T = \operatorname{det} A$.
</p>

<p>
This is easy if you believe Theorem 1.
Cofactor expansion along a row of $A$
is the same as along a column of $A^T$.
</p>

<h2>Theorem 6</h2>

<p>
If $A$ and $B$ are square matrices of the same size then
</p>

<p class=boxed>
$\operatorname{det} (AB) = (\operatorname{det} A) (\operatorname{det} B)$.
</p>

<p>
Magic!
Or, if there is time, I can try to demystify it a little...
</p>

<h2>Clicker questions</h2>

<p>
True or false:
</p>

<ul>
<li> $\det I = 1$. </li>
<li> If $A$ is invertible then $\det A^{-1} = 1 / \det{A}$. </li>
<li> If $A$ has a row of zeros then $\det A = 0$. </li>
<li> If $A$ has two rows the same then $\det A = 0$. </li>
<li> If $A$ has two columns the same then $\det A = 0$. </li>
<li> $\operatorname{det} (2A) = 2 \operatorname{det} A$. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Answer: all true except the last one.
