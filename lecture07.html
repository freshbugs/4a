<h1>&sect;1.7: Linear independence</h1>

<p>
<b>TL;DR</b>
The columns of a matrix are linearly independent
if and only if echelon form has a pivot in every column.
There are other equivalent definitions.
</p>

<h2>Announcements</h2>

<p>
The exam on Monday covers &sect;1.1 &mdash; &sect;1.7.
Bring a blank "bluebook",
which you can buy many places including the bookstore.
Bring a 3-by-5 inch notecard of notes, if you want.
</p>

<p>
I put an old exam on Gauchospace.
I recently changed some words to match this year's syllabus.
</p>

<p>
Clicker grades:
Maybe it shows 0 points on the first class,
which was not supposed to be graded.
Maybe other scores are wrong.
I will worry about this later.
</p>

<h2>Review</h2>

<p> Suppose $A$ is a non-augmented matrix with $m$ rows. </p>

<table class=boxed> <tr>
<td> The columns of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^m$ </td>
<td> &hArr; </td>
<td> echelon form has a pivot in every row. </td>
</tr> </table>

<p>
The opposite of linearly independent is
<span class=green>linearly dependent</span>.
</p>

<h2>Linear independence (easy definition)</h2>

<p> Suppose $A$ is a non-augmented matrix.  </p>

<table class=boxed> <tr>
<td> The columns of $A$ are linearly independent </td>
<td> &hArr; </td>
<td> echelon form has a pivot in every column. </td>
</tr> </table>

<h2>Clicker question</h2>

<p>
The columns of
$\left[
\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array}
\right]$
are
</p>

<ul>
<li> <span class=red>A:</span> Linearly dependent. </li>
<li> <span class=red>B:</span> Linearly independent. </li>
<li> <span class=red>C:</span> I don't know. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Linear independence (equivalent definition on p57)</h2>

<p>
Suppose $\{ \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \}$
is a set of three vectors in $\mathbb{R}^m$.
It could be any number of vectors,
but let's do three to make it easy.
</p>

<table class=boxed> <tr>
  <td>
    $\{ \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \}$
    <br/> is linearly independent
  </td>
  <td> &hArr; </td>
  <td>
    $x \mathbf{u} + y \mathbf{v} + z \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0}$
    <br/> has only the trivial solution.
  </td>
</tr> </table>

<p>
Of course
$x \mathbf{u} + y \mathbf{v} + z \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0}$
always has at least one solution.
If it has exactly one solution then they are linearly independent.
</p>

<table class=boxed> <tr>
  <td>
    $\{ \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \}$
    <br/> is linearly dependent
  </td>
  <td> &hArr; </td>
  <td>
    $x \mathbf{u} + y \mathbf{v} + z \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0}$
    <br/> has a non-trivial solution.
  </td>
</tr> </table>

<p>
A non-trivial solution is
$a \mathbf{u} + b \mathbf{v} + c \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0}$
where <span class=red>at least one</span> of
$a, b, c$ is non-zero.
If there is a non-trivial solution
then there are infinitely many.
</p>

<h2>Clicker question</h2>

<p>
$\{ \mathbf{v}, -\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w} \}$ is
</p>

<ul>
<li> <span class=red>A:</span> Linearly dependent. </li>
<li> <span class=red>B:</span> Linearly independent. </li>
<li> <span class=red>C:</span> It depends. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Linear independence (equivalent definition on p58)</h2>

<p> Suppose $A$ is a non-augmented matrix.  </p>

<table class=boxed> <tr>
<td> The columns of $A$ are linearly independent </td>
<td> &hArr; </td>
<td> $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ has only the trivial solution. </td>
</tr> </table>

<p>
$A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ is homogeneous,
so it always has at least one solution.
If it has exactly one solution then
the columns are linearly independent.
</p>

<table class=boxed> <tr>
<td> The columns of $A$ are linearly dependent </td>
<td> &hArr; </td>
<td> $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ has infinitely many solutions. </td>
</tr> </table>

<p>
If $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ has any non-trivial solution
then it has infinitely many.
</p>

<h2>Clicker question</h2>

<p>
The columns of
$\left[
\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array}
\right]$
are
</p>

<ul>
<li> <span class=red>A:</span> Linearly dependent. </li>
<li> <span class=red>B:</span> Linearly independent. </li>
<li> <span class=red>C:</span> I don't know. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Linear independence (equivalent definition on p59)</h2>

<p class=boxed>
$\{\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}\}$ is linearly dependent
if and only if
one of them is a multiple of the other.
</p>

<p>
This only applies if there are just two vectors.
</p>

<h2>Clicker question</h2>

<p>
$\left\{
\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right],
\left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right],
\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \end{array} \right]
\right\}$
is
</p>

<ul>
<li> <span class=red>A:</span> Linearly dependent. </li>
<li> <span class=red>B:</span> Linearly independent. </li>
<li> <span class=red>C:</span> I don't know. </li>
</ul>


<h2>Theorem 7</h2>

<table class=boxed> <tr>
<td> A set of vectors is linearly dependent
<td> &hArr; </td>
<td> one of them is a linear combination of the others. </td>
</tr> </table>

<p>
If one of the vectors is a multiple of another
then they are linearly dependent,
but that is not the only way.
</p>

<h2>Theorem 8</h2>

<p class=boxed>
Any set of $n+1$ or more vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$
is linearly dependent.
</p>

<p>
A random set of $n$ or fewer vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$
is <span class=red>probably</span> linearly independent,
but not always.
</p>

<h2>Theorem 9</h2>

<p class=boxed>
Any set of vectors that includes the zero vector
is linearly dependent.
</p>
