<h1>&sect;4.3: Linearly independent sets, and bases</h1>

<p>
<b>TL;DR</b>
A basis for something
is a set of vectors that is linearly independent and spans it.
</p>

<h2>Announcements</h2>

<p> The average on the midterm was 51.7 out of 60.</p>

<h2>Confusing issues in this section</h2>

<p>
An <span class=red>indexed set</span> of vectors is something like
$\{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n\}$,
where the vectors come with subscripts.
I tend to call it a <span class=red>list</span> of vectors.
This is to get around the fact that sets are not usually ordered.
Don't worry about it.
</p>

<p>
The book has many examples from calculus,
where the vectors are functions.
I will continue to focus on vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
You can blame me when you are confused in Math 4B.
</p>

<h2>Theorem 4</h2>

<p class=boxed>
A set of at least two non-zero vectors
is linearly dependent
if and only if one of them is a linear combination of the previous ones.
</p>

<h2>Basis</h2>

<p>
A <span class=red>basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$</span>
is a set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$
that is linearly independent and spans $\mathbb{R}^n$.
</p>

<p>
A <span class=red>basis for the column space of $A$</span>
is a set of vectors in the column space of $A$
that is linearly independent
and such that the column space is the span of them.
</p>

<p>
Same for <span class=red>null space</span>.
</p>

<p>
Same for any subspace of any vector space, eg.
$\{ \cos x, \sin x \}$
is a basis for the set of solutions to
$y'' + y = 0$.
</p>

<h2>Clicker question</h2>

<p>
Is
$ \left\{
\left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right],
\left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right],
\left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right]
\right\}$
a basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$?
</p>

<ul>
<li class=inline> <span class=red>A</span> yes </li>
<li class=inline> <span class=red>B</span> no </li>
</ul>

<h2>Clicker question</h2>

<p>
You are given a set of three vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$
and asked if it is a basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$.
You make them the columns of a three-by-three matrix,
row reduce,
and see if there is:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <span class=red>A</span> a pivot in every row </li>
<li> <span class=red>B</span> a pivot in every column </li>
<li> <span class=red>C</span> either one of the above would work </li>
<li> <span class=red>D</span> none of the above would work </li>
</ul>

<h2>Theorem 5 (paraphrased)</h2>

<p>
Suppose $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix.
Remember, the column space is the span of the columns of $A$.
It is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$.
</p>

<p class=boxed>
If one column is a linear combination of the others
then you can delete it
to get a $m \times (n - 1)$ matrix
that has the same column space.
</p>

<h2>Theorem 5&frac12;</h2>

<p>
Here is how to find a basis for the null space of $A$.
</p>

<ol>
<li> Row reduce to reduced echelon form $R$. </li>
<li> Write the general solution to the system of equations
     $[R | \mathbf{0}]$. </li>
<li> Rewrite the solution as
     $\mathbf{x}$ = a linear combination.
     (The scalars are the free variables.) </li>
<li> Rewrite the linear combination as span of a set of vectors. </li>
<li> That set of vectors is automatically a basis! </li>
</ol>

<p> (See comment number 1 on page 203.) </p>

<h2>Theorem 6</h2>

<p>
Here is how to find a basis for the column space of $A$.
</p>

<ol>
<li> Row reduce. </li>
<li> Make a note of which columns have pivots. </li>
<li> <span class=red>Go back</span> to the original matrix $A$. </li>
<li> Take the columns of $A$ that are in the same positions
     as the pivot columns of echelon form. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Clicker question</h2>

<p>
Find a basis for the column space of
$\left[
  \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 \\ 0 & 5 & 10
  \end{array}
\right].$
</p>

<ul>
<li> <span class=red>A</span>
    $\left\{
        \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right],
        \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right] \right\}$
</li>
<li> <span class=red>B</span>
    $\left\{
        \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right],
        \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ 5 \end{array} \right] \right\}$
</li>
<li> <span class=red>C</span>
    $\left\{
        \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right],
        \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ 5 \end{array} \right],
        \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 2 \\ 10 \end{array} \right] \right\}$
</li>
<li> <span class=red>D</span> Two or three of the above. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Clicker question</h2>

<p>
Suppose $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix,
and $R$ is its reduced row echelon form.
True or false:
</p>

<ul>
<li> $A$ and $R$ have the same null space. </li>
<li> $A$ and $R$ have the same column space. </li>
<li> $A$ and $R$ have the same determinant. </li>
<li> If $R$ has determinant zero then so does $A$. </li>
<li> If $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$
     then $R \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Two views of a basis</h2>

<p>
In the children's story "Goldilocks and the three bears",
one chair was too big,
one was too small,
and one was just right.
(Or something like that.)
</p>

<p>
A basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$ has to
span $\mathbb{R}^n$
and be linearly independent.
</p>

<p>
eg., for
$$
\left[ \begin{array}{ccccc}
1 & 2 & 32 & 14 & -5 \\
0 & 3 & 11 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 6 & 22 & 22 & 22 \end{array} \right]
$$
the columns span $\mathbb{R}^3$,
but are linearly dependent.
This is <span class=red>too big</span>.
For
$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2 \\
0 & 3 \\
0 & 6 \end{array} \right]
$$
the columns are linearly independent
but do not span $\mathbb{R}^3$.
This is <span class=red>too small</span>.
For
$$
\left[ \begin{array}{ccccc}
1 & 2 & 14 \\
0 & 3 & 0 \\
0 & 6 & 22 \end{array} \right]
$$
the columns are a basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$.
This is <span class=red>just right</span>.
If you removed a column it would not span any more.
If you added a column it would not be linearly independent any more.
