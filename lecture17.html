<h1>&sect;4.5: The dimension of a vector space</h1>

<p>
<b>TL;DR</b>
The dimension of a vector space
is the number of vectors in a basis.
</p>

<h2>Announcements</h2>

<p>
You do not need a "blue book" for the next exam.
You will write the answers on the exam,
and the TAs will scan them and grade them
with the help of software.
Please see the sample on Gauchospace.
Please memorize the name of your TA and the time of your section.
</p>

<h2>Correction to Theorem 8</h2>

<p> I forgot "onto" in the statement of Theorem 8. </p>

<p class=boxed>
If $\mathcal{B} = \{ \mathbf{b}_1, \dots, \mathbf{b}_n \}$
is a basis for a vector space $V$
then
$$\mathbf{v} \mapsto [\mathbf{v}]_\mathcal{B}$$
is a one-to-one and onto linear transformation from $V$ onto $\mathbb{R}^n$.
</p>

<p>
If you don't know what "one-to-one" and "onto" mean,
look up "bijection".
</p>

<p>
A linear transformation $T$ is called one-to-one and onto
if $T(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{b}$ always has exactly one solution.
</p>

<p>
If $T(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{b}$ sometimes has infinity solutions
then $T$ is many-to-one.
</p>

<p>
If $T(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{b}$ has no solution for some $\mathbf{b}$
then $T$ did not map onto that $\mathbf{b}$.
</p>

<p> Theorem 8 is more conceptual than useful to you at this point.  </p>

<p>
If $V$ was an abstract vector space,
not columns of numbers,
you might pick a basis and use coordinate vectors.
Think of $\mathbf{v}$ as the "real" vector,
and $[\mathbf{v}]_\mathcal{B}$ as "representing" $\mathbf{v}$.
Theorem 8 says that no information is lost in this representation.
</p>

<h2>Confusion: change of coordinates</h2>

<p>
The change of coordinates matrix only applies
when $V = \mathbb{R}^n$.
Vectors are already columns of numbers,
but for some reason you might prefer
to represent them using a non-standard basis $\mathcal{B}$.
</p>

<p>
The map $\mathbf{v} \mapsto [\mathbf{v}]_\mathcal{B}$
is a linear map from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to itself,
so it is given by an $n \times n$ matrix.
</p>

<p>
That matrix is $P_\mathcal{B}$,
whose columns are the basis vectors.
For a square matrix,
"one-to-one and onto" is the same as "invertible".
</p>

<p class=boxed>
$\mathbf{v} = P_\mathcal{B} [\mathbf{v}]_\mathcal{B}, \quad
[\mathbf{v}]_\mathcal{B} = P_\mathcal{B}^{-1} \mathbf{v}$
</p>

<p> This is more conceptual than useful to you at this point.  </p>

<h2>What is dimension?</h2>

<p>
There is a lot of nonsense on the internet and in popular culture.
This video from WIRED is not bad:
</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315"

</iframe> 

<p>
"There are three directions"
or "it takes three numbers to describe a point"
are not great definitions of three dimensions.
The "experiment" starting at 4:50 is better.
It uses "right angles" instead of "linearly independent".
</p>

<h2>Theorem 9</h2>

<p class=boxed>
If $V$ has a basis with $n$ vectors,
then any set of more than $n$ vectors in $V$
must be linearly dependent.
</p>

<h2>Theorem 10</h2>

<p class=boxed>
Any two bases for $V$ must have the same number of vectors.
</p>

<p> [Added later: "bases" is the plural of "basis".] </p>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<p>
If $\{ \mathbf{b}_1, \mathbf{b}_2, \dots, \mathbf{b}_n \}$
is a basis for $V$
then $n$ is the <span class=red>dimension</span> of $V$.
</p>

<p> <span class=red>Notation:</span> dim$(V) = n$. </p>

<p> <span class=red>Zero:</span>
If $V = \{ \mathbf{0} \}$ then dim$(V) = 0$.
</p>

<p>
The set of all functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$
is a vector space that does not have a finite basis.
It is <span class=red>infinite dimensional</span>.
</p>

<p>
A subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$
always has a finite basis.
It is <span class=red>finite dimensional</span>.
</p>

<h2>Clicker question</h2>

<p>What is dim$(\mathbb{R}^3)$?</p>

<ul>
<li class=inline> <span class=red>A</span> $3$. </li>
<li class=inline> <span class=red>B</span> Nope. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Clicker question</h2>

<p> Why? </p>

<ul>
<li class=inline> <span class=red>A</span> 
    Because every vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has three entries. </li>
<li class=inline> <span class=red>B</span> Nope. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Theorem 11</h2>

<p class=boxed>
If $H$ is a subspace of $V$
then $\operatorname{dim} H \le \operatorname{dim} V$.
</p>

<h2>Theorem 12</h2>

<p>
Let $V$ be a vector space
and $\mathcal{B} = \{ \mathbf{b}_1, \mathbf{b}_2, \dots, \mathbf{b}_n\}$
be a set of $n$ different vectors in $V$.
</p>

<div class=boxed>
Any two of the following implies the third:
<ul>
<li> $\mathcal{B}$ is linearly independent. </li>
<li> $\mathcal{B}$ spans $V$. </li>
<li> dim$(V) = n$. </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Clicker space</h2>

<p>
Suppose reduced echelon form for $A$ looks like
$$\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & * & 0 & * \\
0 & 0 & 1 & * \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}
\right].$$
What is the dimension of its null space?
</p>

<ul>
<li class=inline> <span class=red>A</span> 1 </li>
<li class=inline> <span class=red>B</span> 2 </li>
<li class=inline> <span class=red>C</span> 3 </li>
<li class=inline> <span class=red>D</span> 4 </li>
<li class=inline> <span class=red>E</span> No way to tell </li>
</ul>
