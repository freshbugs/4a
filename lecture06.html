<h1>&sect;1.6. Applications of linear systems</h1>

<p>
<b>TL;DR</b>
Here are some examples where you might end up
solving a system of linear equations.
</p>

<h2>Announcement</h2>

<p>
No clicker questions today.
</p>

<h2>Clarification of Theorem 6</h2>

<p>
Suppose you have a non-homogeneous system of linear equations
that has infinitely many solutions,
and the "corresponding homogeneous system"
is the same but with all zeros on the right of the equals signs.
</p>

<p>
Let's say
<span class="green">N</span>s are solutions to
the non-homogeneous system, and
<span class="green">H</span>s are solutions to
the corresponding homogeneous system.
</p>

<p class=boxed>
An <span class="green">N</span>
plus an <span class="green">H</span>
is always another <span class="green">N</span>.
</p>

<p>
Compare, the superposition principle says
an <span class="green">H</span>
plus an <span class="green">H</span>
is always another <span class="green">H</span>.
</p>

<h2>Leontief exchange model</h2>

<p>
Alice, Bob and Charlie live on an island.
The economy consists of three products: apples, bananas and cherimoyas.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Alice sells one apple to Bob and one to Charlie. </li>
<li> Bob sells two bananas to Charlie. </li>
<li> Charlie sells one cherimoya to Alice. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<span class=red>Question:</span>
If everybody ends up with the same amount of money they started with,
which fruit is the most expensive?
</p>

<p>
The prices are $a$, $b$ and $c$.
Alice receives and gives the same amount of money.
Same for Bob and Charlie.
</p>

<ul>
<li> $2a = c$ </li>
<li> $2b = a$ </li>
<li> $c = a + 2b$ </li>
</ul>

<p> Solve. There is one free variable. Check your answer.  </p>

<p>
<span class=red>Answer:</span> Cherimoyas.
(Or maybe the trivial solution: all fruits are free.)
</p>

<p>
Leontief did something like this in 1949
using real-world data and a computer.
</p>

<h2>Balancing chemical equations</h2>

<p>
When methane burns,
it combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water.
</p>

<blockquote>
&#x2B1C; CH<sub>4</sub> + &#x2B1C; O<sub>2</sub>
&nbsp; &xrarr; &nbsp;
&#x2B1C; CO<sub>2</sub> + &#x2B1C; H<sub>2</sub>O
</blockquote>

<p>
<span class=red>Question:</span>
How many O<sub>2</sub> molecules does it take
to burn each CH<sub>4</sub> molecule?
</p>

<p>
Let the blanks be $x$, $y$, $z$ and $w$.
To balance the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms:
</p>

<ul>
<li> $x = z$ </li>
<li> $4x = 2w$ </li>
<li> $2y = 2z + w$ </li>
</ul>

<p> Solve. There is one free variable. Check your answer. </p>

<p> <span class=red>Answer:</span> Two.  </p>

<h2>Network flow</h2>

<p>
A traffic circle connects four roads.
Every minute:
</p>

<ul>
<li> One car enters from the west. </li>
<li> One car enters from the east. </li>
<li> One car leaves to the north. </li>
<li> One car leaves to the south. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<span class=red>Question:</span>
Which quarter(s) of the circle get the most traffic?
</p>

<p>
Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ be the number of cars per minute
on the north-west, north-east, south-west and south-east quarter circles.
</p>

<p>
The north point on the circle has the same number of cars entering and leaving.
Same for west, east, and south.
</p>

<ul>
<li> $b = a + 1$ </li>
<li> $a + 1 = c$ </li>
<li> $d + 1 = b$ </li>
<li> $c = d + 1$ </li>
</ul>

<p> Solve. There is one free variable. Check your answer.  </p>

<p>
<span class=red>Answer:</span>
The north-east and south-west quarters of the circle
both get the most traffic.
</p>

<p>
<span class=red>Bonus:</span>
What is the solution to the corresponding homogeneous system?
(Hint:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAgX6qlJEMc">
the roundabout in the movie "European vacation"</a>).
</p>

<p>
The same model applies whenever stuff is moving through a network
&mdash; electrons through circuits, products through distribution networks,
water through pipes, etc.
</p>

<p>
The original Google Page Rank Algorithm (TM) uses linear algebra to
decide which web pages are the most important.
It's a bit like traffic flow where the "cars" are web
surfers clicking links at random.
</p>

<h2>Curve fitting</h2>

<p>
<span class=red>Question:</span>
A parabola goes through
$(1, 3)$, $(2, 7)$ and $(-1, 1)$.
What is the $y$-intercept?
</p>

<p>
$y = ax^2 + bx + c$.
To go through those three points:
</p>

<ul>
<li> $a + b + c = 3$ </li>
<li> $4a + 2b + c = 7$ </li>
<li> $a - b + c = 1$ </li>
</ul>

<p> Solve. There is a unique solution. Check your answer. </p>

<p> <span class=red>Answer:</span> $1$ </p>

<p>
(The parabola is also called an interpolating polynomial.
See the exercises at the end of &sect;1.2.)
